Here are the **most recent web and UI design trends as of late November 2025**—newer than glassmorphism and actively evolving:

- **AI-Powered Design & Personalization**
  - AI tools automatically generate layouts, suggest color palettes, and optimize user experiences based on real-time data and behavior.
  - Design automation and adaptive UIs offer truly personalized web experiences.[1][2]

- **Immersive 3D Elements & Mixed Reality**
  - Interactive 3D objects, AR/VR integration, and motion-rich interfaces go mainstream.
  - Layering, overlapping elements, and dynamic layouts add dimensionality and tactile feel.[3][4][5]

- **Zero Interface & Minimalist Brutalism**
  - Seamless, ultra-minimal “zero interface” designs focus on usability and invisible navigation. Brutalism's raw shapes and bold contrasts inject visual authenticity.[6][7][4]

- **Micro-Interactions & Thoughtful Motion**
  - Tiny, fluid animations and responsive feedback are used to guide users, making interfaces feel alive and intuitive.[8][9][1]

- **Voice & Conversational UI**
  - Voice-based navigation, chatbots, and AI assistants are transforming how users interact with apps and websites.[7][10][3]

- **Neubrutalism (New Brutalism)**
  - A fresh, experimental take: bold colors, imperfect shapes, rough geometry—often layered with motion and AI-driven highlights.[11][6]

- **Sustainable & Carbon-Aware Design**
  - More sites are adopting eco-friendly design practices—minimal energy themes, simplified elements, and performance-centric features.[12][1][6]

- **Mobile-First, Dark Mode, and Accessibility**
  - Dark mode is standard, and layouts are mobile-centric with customizable accessibility features like configurable text and color schemes.[13][14][12]

- **Bold Typography, Experimental Fonts, and Print-Inspired Looks**
  - Vivid font choices, unique typographic treatments, and layouts that borrow from magazine or print design.[9][12]

These trends are widely featured on sites like **Awwwards**, **Behance**, and top design agency portfolios. If you want to see or open recent real examples from these trends, let me know your preferred style or effect!
