🎯 Optimization Analysis: Recruitment Process

Current Performance:
├── Time to Hire: 45 days (Industry avg: 38 days)
├── Cost per Hire: $4,200 (Industry avg: $3,500)
├── Quality of Hire: 72% (Good)
├── Candidate Experience: 3.8/5 (Fair)

🔍 Bottlenecks Identified:
1. Resume Screening: 8 days (Can reduce to 2 days)
2. Interview Scheduling: 5 days (Can reduce to 1 day)
3. Feedback Collection: 4 days (Can automate)

🚀 AI Optimization Recommendations:

Priority 1: Implement AI Screening
├── Impact: -6 days time-to-hire
├── Cost: $500/month
├── ROI: 300% in 3 months
└── Implementation: 2 days

Priority 2: Automated Scheduling
├── Impact: -4 days time-to-hire
├── Cost: $200/month
├── ROI: 250% in 2 months
└── Implementation: 1 day

Priority 3: Predictive Matching
├── Impact: +15% quality of hire
├── Cost: $800/month
├── ROI: 400% in 6 months
└── Implementation: 5 days

Expected Outcomes:
✅ Time to Hire: 45 → 31 days (-31%)
✅ Cost per Hire: $4,200 → $3,100 (-26%)
✅ Quality of Hire: 72% → 87% (+21%)
✅ Candidate Experience: 3.8 → 4.5/5 (+18%)
